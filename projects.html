      <dt>Raspberry Pi Music Server</dt>
      <dd><em>A side project on Raspberry Pi:</em>
        This project was a Webapp for controlling local music player running on Raspberry Pi and can be controlled from a webpage on any device.<a href="https://github.com/dtchanpura/yummy-octo-musique">Github</a></dd>

      <dt>SplitBot</dt>
      <dd><em>A side project using Telegram Bot API:</em>
        Telegram is a messaging platform and recently they launched their API for creating BOTs. I made a simple balance keeping bot in Python deployed on Heroku Cloud. It actually manages balances showing who leads and who is trailing behind. Try it <a href="https://telegram.me/SplitBot">@SplitBot</a>

      <dd><em>A side project on Raspberry Pi for managing and marking attendance:</em>
        A Raspberry Pi project using Flask a micro-webframework and QR codes for attendance marking.
      The project consists of developing a front-end for administration and using just webcam and LED indicators for indicating if attendance is marked or not.
      This project used a great combination of hashing algorithms and encoding it into QRCode using various APIs available.<a href="http://piatt1.herokuapp.com/">Link</a> but work is still in progress</dd>

      <dt>Eye Tracking based on OpenCV</dt>
      <dd><em>Final year project carried out at IIT Gandhinagar:</em>
        This project has its requirement of OpenCV for detecting the eye pupil using a simple USB camera.
      The objective was to make an inexpensive eye tracker which is actually fulfilled by an USB camera and OpenCV (Open Source Libraries for Computer Vision)</dd>

      <dt>Home Automation</dt>
      <dd><em>A semester project:</em>
        A simple home automation (without IoT) using a TV remote control as a part of semester projects in college using 8051 microcontroller.</dd>
