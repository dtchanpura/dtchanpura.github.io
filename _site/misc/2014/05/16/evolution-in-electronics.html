        <h2>Evolution: Electronics...</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Electronics have been the booming field among most of the fields. Electronics is now a days explained simply as the base of many (I mean all) devices which have an ability do anything smart.</p>

<p>But thats not just true. There are lot many things which are more to Electronics. This is just a way of saying thank you to &quot;Electronics&quot; which I thought I should as I have been using a lot of it now a days. Also my laptop from where I am typing. But now it is not just a Laptop which can be used as a portable computer, a phone which can be and soon there will be a small watch which will have a powerful processor calling for using the power somewhere else if needed.</p>

<p>Well all started with 4 bit processors and now we have a compliance of 32- or 64-bit processing on one chip. But the thing is we (esp. I) was not even born when the first computer was booted up. Well it might be but i gained some knowledge only after 1999 which was the time I saw or used first computer. Anyone want to guess the specifications.. ah.. it was a celeron processor with 32 mega-bytes of RAM and 4.0 GB of Hard-Drive. and now even my phone has a 2.0 GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 1.5GHz Dual Core Processor. So we can say its evolving.</p>

<p>Smaller the size and better the performance makes it quite useful. This shows that there&#39;s no place where electronic item is not used. But yeah the topic is about evolution and not a survey. So here&#39;s an image and a story there after about me.</p>

<p><a href="/images/evolve.jpg"><div id="container"><img src="/images/thumbs/evolve_thumb.jpg" /></div></a></p>

<h4>Story:</h4>

<p>I am a 21 year old student working on different programming platforms/languages like Assembly, C/C++, Python, etc. Now it may seem very unthinkable programming a graphics LCD using 8051 and that too in assembly (plus from scratch). So to minimize we have Embedded C which is very useful for some pretty tough tasks like this. So how the journey started. I was in my 5th grade and I started knowing what programming language BASIC but now i don&#39;t know how it looked like. The point here is knowing is just a start we need to go deep. So I talked to my dad he is a Professor and taught me the advanced electronics. Like you may think I was not knowing what/how transistor works but yeah I was having some idea about programming in a 8085.</p>

<p>This all changed when I entered in College. &quot;The Basics&quot;. Well college taught me the basics and from that I just came to one conclusion that I can am somewhere behind the time. But yeah sometimes it helps. Never mind earlier that I was using Assembly and now something called &quot;Arduino&quot;. Well see the picture shows the way of evolving and what I have seen till now. I am just a simple person who does not have much to show but yeah I have been to that situation when you know what happens inside the big/small machines.</p>

<p>Well then came this Beagle Bones and Raspberry Pis. A part of me just shook when I heard about it and used it for the first time. Its just feels like debugging a code you know whats gonna happen next. But debugging is easy in coding but when it comes to change hardware its tough. This was the thing I loved about being in Electronics which gave me power to understand both Heart(hardware) and the Brain(software).</p>

<p>The moment when you know how things work from the inside not because you coded it but how the machine understood is the moment of lifetime. Don&#39;t Miss it..Be a part in Evolution..</p>
