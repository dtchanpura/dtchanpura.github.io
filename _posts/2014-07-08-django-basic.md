For those who don't know what frameworks are I can explain you it as a template. Web-Frameworks are like templates where the bare bone of a website is given you need to append functionalities required and some basic modifications in the framework code. An example of this kind of frameworks is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>

Frameworks are a collection of components you can use to build a website. You don't have to write all code from scratch. You can just take already existing code and reuse it. For more details about frameworks I recommend the post by Satyajit Sahoo in the References .
