Recently I was studying microprocessors and I thought this would be a better start for my blog i have started this post with a poll to see that out of many processor manufacturer who is the better from them.

The Microprocessor is a combination of many functional blocks such as Data and Address Buffer, Serial Communication, Interrupt Control, Controls, etc.

The figure below shows the functional block diagram of Intel 8085 Microprocessor.

8080/85 are the basic microprocessors which were obtained by some modifications in the earlier 4004 microprocessor which were of 4 bit databus and having several more problems.

The different blocks and its use will be given in another post but the basic pin diagram is shown below.
