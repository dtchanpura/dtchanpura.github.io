Well I came across a blog post from Mozilla writing about its improved sync features and a new pre-Beta testing version browser "Aurora" for their developers. The best thing about Mozilla is its openness and they have mentioned it at many places. Still by this there aren't many who are using Firefox lately, its because Chromium, or let's say Google Chrome.

The main reason behind this was usability. Comparing Firefox with Chrome I had a better experience with chrome because of faster or speedier than Firefox. But I after some usage got to know it has been taking up so much memory and some privacy issues I really don't care about both but still what if you want any of them.

So let's come back to the topic Aurora is been developed well seems like you are using a best browser ever. Still has some bugs but it will fixed soon in the version 29. the UI is quite good its having some great features of customization like giving shortcuts for browser settings like history, downloads, new tab or sync.

"Sync": Well it took me around 2 days to figure out how sync works and syncing my devices or to know how to sync two of my devices earlier in old Firefox. The settings were for mostly the developers and not that user friendly. But they have achieved a success in making it user friendly like chrome. Just sign in with your email address and choose password of your choice. That's it. Now it may seem why they didn't add it in the first place. let's stick to it that they didn't consider it important because after knowing how to sync I also was thinking it as it was so simple.

You can expect a good result from Firefox but the most users are liking chrome because of the integration of most of its Google products. The time when users think they want to use a normal Browser rather than a fully functioning OS that time a user will come back to Firefox. I even use Firefox mostly but some things like many special effects like animations are only used in Chrome (and to some extent Safari).

I am hoping that the goal of Firefox achieving one of the best browser will be accomplished soon and hats off to all the contributors.

Here are some of the screenshots for Aurora and the way it looks. Its look is almost the same but you can expect some changes and the other one is from my Nexus using Aurora for a day and its not much different from original Firefox just changed a bit.

The feature is about 3D representation of A whole Web Page. I have attaches the screenshots and you can see it is having the blog which your a reading right now. and the github page. There are towers for G+ button and the other for tweet but as my webpage is simple it does not have any of the different <code>div</code>&quot;s
