I think I may have said that drawing polygons is quite tough. It is but it can be made easy. Polygons are simply just joining some points. Like in one's childhood we play that puzzle of joining the dots or points which are been numbered, here also we say OpenCV is that child who just understands counting and we plot those points in 2 dimension plane. So consider this example and learn it in a way if you are making a child learn how to draw...

The Use.. One may think why to use polygon. Like we can make highlight a portion or Region of Interest by rectangle or circle or even ellipse. So answer that question lets consider a problem of highlighting some part. Lets see the following figure.

<div id="container">

</div>
So as seen from the figure we get the idea of use of polygons. Like here in face detection we can see the eyes then nose and lips, even eye-brows. this could be matched with the original frame or structure. Again see the following image as all the different shapes or something
