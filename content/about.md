## About

Hello everyone! I am Darshil Chanpura, a geek who is into many things related to many different platforms. I have been working with Raspberry Pi recently and some of the posts are like projects and are really interesting do try them. I mostly work on Golang, HTML with CSS using TailwindCSS and little bit of JS with Svelte.

I am a full time GNU/Linux User and also love to try out new distros now and then. Most of my work is on GitHub or [Gitea](https://git.dcpri.me). Feel free to contact me by mail (dtchanpura at protonmail dot com) or any of the below.
